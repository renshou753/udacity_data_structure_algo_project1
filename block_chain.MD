#### Code design

In this program linked list was used to capture the structure of the block chain, in this version of the block chain the node will have the linkage to the previous hashed node which is similar to the structure of a linked list.

#### Efficiency

This block chain was implemented with linked list so the time efficiency and the space efficiency will be exactly the same as linked list.

Time efficiency for search function will be O(n), for inserting new element the time efficiency will be O(1).

For Storage the linked list takes less memory than array because it could dynamically change the size based on number of input, average is o(n)
